<h1>Archival Resource Key (ARK) Identifiers</h1>
<p><strong>NOTE: as of February 2021, the best information about ARKs resides with the</strong>
<a class="reference external" href="https://arks.org">ARK Alliance</a> (<a class="reference external" href="https://arks.org">https://arks.org</a>). <strong>This page may not be kept up-to-date.</strong></p>
<p>ARK identifiers are URLs designed to support long-term access to
information objects. To get started creating ARKs, first fill out the
<a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1">ARK request form</a>, and to come up to speed quickly, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Identifiers+FAQ">ARKs
FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2001, ARK identifiers were designed to identify objects of
any type:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>digital objects – documents, databases, images, software, websites, etc.</li>
<li>physical objects – books, bones, statues, etc.</li>
<li>living beings and groups – people, animals, companies, orchestras, etc.</li>
<li>intangible objects – places, chemicals, diseases, vocabulary terms, performances, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>ARKs are assigned for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>affordability – there are no fees to assign or use ARKs</li>
<li>self-sufficiency – you can host ARKs on your own web server, eg, <a class="reference external" href="/e/noid.html">Noid (Nice
Opaque Identifiers)</a> open source software</li>
<li>portability – you can move ARKs to other servers without losing their core
identities</li>
<li>global resolvability – you can host ARKs at a well-known server, eg, at the
N2T.net (Name-to-Thing) resolver</li>
<li>density – ARKs handle mixed case, permitting shorter identifiers (CD, Cd,
cD, cd are all distinct)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some advantages of ARKs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>simplicity – access relies only on mainstream web &quot;redirects&quot; and ordinary
&quot;get&quot; requests</li>
<li>utility – with &quot;inflections&quot; (different endings), an ARK should access data
, metadata, promises, and more</li>
<li>compatibility – inflections don't conflict with &quot;linked data content
negotiation&quot; (a harder and limited way to access metadata)</li>
<li>versatility – ARKs support persistence statements to describe different
kinds of long-term access</li>
<li>transparency – no identifier can guarantee stability, and ARK inflections
help users make informed judgements</li>
<li>visibility – syntax rules make ARKs easy to extract from texts and to
compare for variant and containment relationships</li>
<li>openness – unlike other persistent identifiers, ARKs don't lock you into
one specific, fee-based management and resolution infrastructure</li>
<li>impact – ARKs appear in the Data Citation Index ℠ and in
ORCID researcher profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2001 over 650 organizations across the world registered
to assign ARKs. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/naan_registry.txt">The registry</a> includes libraries, archives, museums
(Smithsonian), publishers, government agencies, academic institutions
(Princeton), and technology companies (Google). To have your institution
registered, use the <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1">ARK request form</a>. Some of the major users are</p>

<h1>ARK Anatomy</h1>
<p>An ARK is represented by a sequence of characters that contains the label,
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot;. When embedded in a URL, it is preceded by the protocol
(&quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://</span></tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://</span></tt>&quot;) and name of a service that provides support
for that ARK. That service name, or the &quot;Name Mapping Authority&quot; (NMA), is
mutable and replaceable, as neither the web server itself nor the current web
protocols are expected to last longer than the identified objects. The
immutable, globally unique identifier follows the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot; label. This
includes a &quot;Name Assigning Authority Number&quot; (NAAN) identifying the naming
organization, followed by the name that it assigns to the object. Please visit
the <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1">ARK request form</a> if you are interested in generating and using ARKs for
your information objects.</p>
<p>Here is a diagrammed example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
   http://example.org/ark:/12025/654xz321/s3/f8.05v.tiff
   \________________/ \__/ \___/ \______/ \____________/
     (replaceable)     |     |      |       Qualifier
          |       ARK Label  |      |    (NMA-supported)
          |                  |      |
Name Mapping Authority       |    Name (NAA-assigned)
         (NMA)               |
                  Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN)
</pre>
<p>The ARK syntax can be summarized,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[http://NMA/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]
</pre>
<p>The NMA part, which makes the ARK actionable (clickable in a web browser), is
in brackets to indicate that it is optional and replaceable. ARKs are intended
to work with objects that last longer than the organizations that provide
services for them, so when the provider changes it should not affect the
object's identity. A different provider hosting the object would simply replace
the NMA to reflect the new &quot;home&quot; of the object. For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://bnf.fr/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
<p>might become</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://portico.org/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naan-the-name-assigning-authority-number">
<h1>NAAN: the Name Assigning Authority Number</h1>
<p>The NAAN part, following the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot; label, uniquely identifies the
organization that assigned the Name part of the ARK. Often the initial access
provider (the first NMA) coincides with the original namer (represented by the
NAAN), however, access may be provided by one or more different entities
instead of or in addition to the original naming authority.</p>
<p>The NAAN used above, 13030, represents the California Digital Library (CDL). As
of 2020, over 600 organizations have registered for ARK NAANs, including
numerous universities, Google, the Internet Archive, WIPO, the British Library,
and other national libraries.</p>
<p>Any stable memory organization may obtain a NAAN at no cost and begin assigning
ARKs. Please fill out the <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1">ARK request form</a> if you are interested in
generating and using ARKs for your information objects.</p>
<p>CDL maintains a complete registry of all currently assigned NAANs, which is
mirrored at the (U.S.) National Library of Medicine and the Bibliothèque
nationale de France.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-and-managing-arks">
<h1>Creating and Managing ARKs</h1>
<p>Once your organization has a Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN), you may
begin using it immediately to assign ARKs.</p>
<p>In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful to
consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes of, say
1-5 characters, eg, names of the form &quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ark:/NAAN/xt3....</span></tt>&quot; for each
&quot;sub-publisher&quot; in an organization. Opaque prefixes that only have meaning to
information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in schemes
such as ISBN and ISSN. The ARK specification is currently the best guide for
how to create URLs that comply with ARK rules, although it is fairly technical.</p>
<p>You can use any system you wish to manage your identifiers. One approach is to
create and assign ARKs as a side-effect of deposit into a content repository,
with ARKs publicized as being hosted on your server, eg,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://myrepo.example.org/ark:/12345/bcd987
</pre>
<p>Another option is to use the EZID service (<a class="reference external" href="http://ezid.cdlib.org">http://ezid.cdlib.org</a>), which means
your ARKs would appear to be hosted at n2t.net, as in</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/bcd987
</pre>
<p>As with any identifier scheme, persistence requires a redirectable reference to
content in stable storage. EZID operates on a cost-recovery basis and can be
used to manage your namespace, which includes minting and resolving ARKs (and
other identifiers), as well as maintaining metadata. There's is also guidance
on <a class="reference external" href="https://arks.org/about/identifier-concepts-and-conventions/">Identifier Conventions</a> available.</p>
<p>Because long-term identifiers often look like random strings of letters and
digits, organizations typically use software to generate (or mint, in ARK
parlance) and track identifiers. To mint ARKs, you may use any software that
can produce identifiers conforming to the ARK specification. CDL uses the open
source <a class="reference external" href="/e/noid.html">Noid</a> (nice opaque identifiers, rhymes with &quot;employed&quot;) software, which
creates minters and accepts commands that operate them. The noid software
documentation explains how to use noid not only to mint identifiers but also to
serve as an institution's &quot;identifier resolver&quot;.</p>
<p>Once minted and publicized as being associated with a specific object, the ARK
becomes a stable, unique, and compact reference that can be included in metadata
records, databases, redirection tables, etc. It is often useful to generate and
assign ARKs well before institutional commitment has been decided because it is
easier than changing the original object identifier that may have been in long
established use prior to that decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arks-in-action-inflections">
<h1>ARKs in Action – Inflections</h1>
<p>An ARK provides extra services above and beyond that of an ordinary URL. Instead
of connecting to one thing, an ARK should connect to three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the object itself,</li>
<li>a brief metadata record if you append a single question mark to the ARK, and</li>
<li>a maintenance commitment from the current server when you append two question marks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a achieved through the use of &quot;inflections&quot;, or different kinds of
endings. With no ending, the ARK (in a URL) gives you what you expect from a web
browser. If you add a single '<tt class="docutils literal">?</tt>' to the end, for example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth346793/?
</pre>
<p>it returns a brief machine- and eye-readable metadata record; in this case, an
Electronic Resource Citation (ERC) using Dublin Core Kernel metadata., such
as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
erc:
who: Dallas (Tex.). Police Dept.
what: [Photographs of Identification Cards]
when: 1963
where: http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth346793/
</pre>
<p>Adding '<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">??</span></tt>' to the end should return a policy statement. It is
a side-benefit of ARKs that an object's metadata doesn't need an identifier
different from that for the object, which cuts in half the number of
identifiers that need to be generated and managed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="name-assignment-and-support-policy-statements">
<h1>Name Assignment and Support Policy Statements</h1>
<p>As an example, the California Digital Library (CDL) assigns identifiers within
the ARK domain under the NAAN 13030 and according to the following principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No ARK shall be re-assigned; that is, once an ARK-to-object association has
been made public, that association shall be considered unique into the
indefinite future.</li>
<li>To help them age and travel well, the Name part of CDL-assigned ARKs shall
contain no widely recognizable semantic information (to the extent possible).</li>
<li>CDL-assigned ARKs shall be generated with a terminal check character that
guarantees them against single character errors and transposition errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Institutions that generate ARKs may want to follow similar principles or develop
their own assignment policies.</p>
<p>Similarly, but in the role of an NMA and not an NAA, institutions will want to
develop service commitment statements for the objects themselves. These NMA
commitments are different from NAA identifier assignment policies. In many
cases, the NAA will operate initially as the first NMA, but for long-lived
objects over time, chances are that these will become different organizations
(e.g., a highly successful object may easily outlive its NAA).</p>
<p>In developing such statements, it is useful to recognize first, that managing a
digital object may require altering it as appropriate to ensure its stability,
and second, that the declared level of commitment may change as the requirements
and policies for persistence become better understood over time, and as the
institution implements procedures and guidelines] for maintaining the objects
that it manages. The US National Library of Medicine has developed some
permanence ratings that may be of interest here.</p>
<p>As before, there is also information available about <a class="reference external" href="https://arks.org/about/identifier-concepts-and-conventions/">Identifier Conventions</a>.</p>
